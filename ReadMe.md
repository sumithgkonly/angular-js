A}.  As per me its right impimentatin, because while i was wrinting a code in VS Code editiot its showing the hint's of all other properties which i can use if it was not it would have not shown the hint specially in VS Code.

B}. As we talk about performance  of the page is very high because.

        1. Load time less
        2. we have created the dom but not the vertual DOM
        3. we can do dom manupulation.
        4. less cost.

        so the performance of the page will be high at this point.

  C}. Event bubbling meaning 
  
     The event bubbles up from parent to parent until it is handled, or until it reaches the document object.

     to handel this we need to add addEventListener

  D}. In this project i have not produced it, because i know how to resolve it but not the otherwise.
